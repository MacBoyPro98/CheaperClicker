# [Cheaper Clicker]
by Team CheaperClicker (Jon Fenn, Connor Mote, Nathan Teeter, and Jacob Winters)

## [Introduction]
We will create a proof of concept for a digital classroom quizzing system, similar to kahoot.it or the clickers we have used in class. Students will use their phones to answer questions shown on a main projected display. The main display will receive live updates of student responses via server-sent events.
